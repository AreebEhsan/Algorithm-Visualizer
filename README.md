# Sorting Algorithms Visualizer

This project is a visual representation of sorting algorithms, specifically Bubble Sort. The visualization is created using Python with `matplotlib` to help illustrate how sorting algorithms work. The elements being sorted are color-coded, with sorted elements highlighted in green and unsorted elements in blue.

## Demo

This GIF shows the Bubble Sort algorithm in action, with elements being color-coded to indicate their sorted (green) and unsorted (blue) status.

## Features

- **Interactive Visualization**: Watch the sorting process in real-time.
- **Color-Coded Elements**: Green for sorted elements, blue for unsorted.
- **Customizable Array Size**: Easily adjust the size of the array being sorted.
